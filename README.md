# Comparing Langauges 

The languages that are being compared in this project are rust, c++, c and go. 

Each of the submodules here have a readme with instructions on running them. 

There is a csv file called speedup.csv that has the latency of the single thread and multithread solutions and then the speedup also.

You can read more about it on my website or in my paper.
